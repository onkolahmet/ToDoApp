# Functionality of the app 
- User can create numerous of custom lists and add or deletes an item
- In a further time they can revisit these lists and make adjustments on them if they wish since data is dynamically rendered by EJS files.

- What is meant by that is, neither user adds or deletes an element from a list, nor refreshes or closes the page; data will remain unchanged and user may visit in a further time.
